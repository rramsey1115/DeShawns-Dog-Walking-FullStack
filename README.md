This is a project for my server-side curriculum at Nashville Software School. 

This is the first time I have used my client-side skills, React, JS, CSS, HTML, and COMBINED them with my new skills in server-side using C# endpoints. 

This project was also presented to us in a workplace simulated fashion - we were given user stories and required to create wireframes, ERD, and a GitHub project board with tickets for each user story.

I became much more familiar with github project boards, tickets, and checking out to branches for each ticket, a skill I had used in the past only on group projects.

DeShawn's Dogwalking is an application designed for dog owners who need a hired walker to take their fur baby for walks during the day or while they are out of town.

The user is able to:
- add dogs
- remove dogs
- see which walkers are available in each city by filtering results
- see dogs which need walkers in that city
- assign dogs to walkers
- update and delete walkers,
- essentially functioning as an admin for the business site

This project was a great stepping stone in my coding journey to being a full-stack developer, the next step is to build a full-stack application using requests to SQL which I cannot wait to learn about!
